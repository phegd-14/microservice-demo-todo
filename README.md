- **Frontend (React)** â†’ Simple UI to interact with the services.

## ðŸš€ Running the Project

### 1. Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/phegd-14/microservice-demo-todo
cd microservice-demo-todo
```

---

### 2. Run Backend Services

Each service has its own folder (user-service, task-service, deadline-service).
Install Dependencies
Inside each service folder:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

---

### 3. Run Frontend(React)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

### Notes

Make sure all 3 services are running before starting the frontend.  
JWT secret (supersecret) must be the same across services.  
SQLite DB files will be auto-created in each service folder.  
Use Thunder Client / Postman to test APIs if needed.
